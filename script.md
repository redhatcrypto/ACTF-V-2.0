<!-- Implementation Strategy for Essential Features

To ensure that we implement only the features that significantly enhance profitability, we will prioritize the following modifications based on their potential impact and feasibility:

1. Relative Volume Approach
Implementation:
Modify the volume threshold logic to allow trades if the current volume is rising, even if it is below the predefined threshold.
Use a rolling average of the volume to determine the trend (increasing or decreasing).
Expected Impact: This feature can capture trades in rising markets, potentially increasing the number of profitable trades.
2. Adjusted Trend Confirmation Logic
Implementation:
Reduce the weight of trend confirmation when RSI/Stoch RSI align for a trade.
Introduce a parameter to control the weight of trend confirmation, allowing for fine-tuning.
Expected Impact: This adjustment can lead to more trades being executed when indicators align, increasing the chances of capturing profitable movements.
3. Trade Opportunity Log
Implementation:
Create a log to track skipped trades, including the conditions that led to skipping and the subsequent price movements.
Analyze the logged data periodically to assess the profitability of skipped trades.
Expected Impact: This feature will provide insights into the effectiveness of the trading strategy and help identify patterns that can be adjusted for better performance.
4. Dynamic Volume Threshold
Implementation:
Implement a dynamic volume threshold that adjusts based on recent market activity, rather than a fixed value.
Use historical volume data to set a baseline and adjust the threshold accordingly.
Expected Impact: A dynamic threshold can adapt to changing market conditions, allowing for more trades in volatile markets.
5. Multiple Time Frame Analysis for Trend Confirmation
Implementation:
Use multiple time frames to assess trend confirmation, allowing for a more comprehensive view of market conditions.
For example, check the trend on both the primary trading timeframe and a higher timeframe.
Expected Impact: This can improve the accuracy of trend confirmation, leading to better trade decisions.
6. Regular Monitoring and Adjustment
Implementation:
Set up a system for regular performance reviews of the trading strategy, including analyzing the trade opportunity log and adjusting parameters as needed.
Expected Impact: Continuous improvement based on performance data can lead to sustained profitability over time. -->
